								As you probably learnt in school, the Pythagorean theorem states that given a right-angled triangle, 
								the hypothenuse squared is equal to the sum of the two other sides squared. In other words, a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are a variety of ways of proving this theorem, one of which is demonstrated in the app above. The app probably requires some further explanation, so here goes:
							</p>
							<p>
								The crucial idea one needs to keep in mind is that the area of a parallelogram with height h perpendicular to one of its sides b, is equal to
								a rectangle with sides h and b, as demonstrated in the image below:
							</p>
							<img src="images/ParallelogramArea.png" alt="Image showing the area of a parallelogram" width="400" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
							<p>
								In the app above, each of the two smaller squares is turned into a parallelogram by moving one of its sides. The area of this parallelogram is equal to the
								original square, since the distance between the two parallel sides remains the same.
							</p>
							<p>
								Next, each of the newly created parallelograms is turned into a rectangle. The area of this new rectangle is likewise equal to that of the parallogram, by virtue
								of the same principle shown in the picture.
							</p>
							<p>
								When both transformations have been made, it is evident that the combination of the two new rectangles has the same size as the
								large square, formed by the hypothenuse.
